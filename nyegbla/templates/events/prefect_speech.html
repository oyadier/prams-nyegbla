      The event at Prampram Senior High School was a resounding success, combining spiritual guidance with crucial health education. The knowledge shared about HIV/AIDS is vital for empowering students to make informed choices about their health. Such initiatives not only help nurture well-rounded students but also contribute positively to the school community. We look forward to hosting more events that enrich our students academically, spiritually, and socially.</p>
